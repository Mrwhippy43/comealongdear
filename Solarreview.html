<h2>PowerOak Solar Panel: Portable 200W Off-Grid Solution</h2>
 <h3>Welcome to this review page where we will share our experience of using the 200w PowerOak Solar Panel</h3>

  <p>When we started our Vanlife journey in 2021, we didn’t have a clue about what our power needs would be and how to choose or obtain Solar power. As we   intended to live and travel full time in our van so finding a reliable and practical source of off-grid electricity was one of our top priorities.</p>
  <p>We initially went to a motorhome sales venue for guidance on how we could get solar for our van and how this could be installed.</p>
  <p>The helpful staff had a look over the van and made a few measurements, but we were disheartened to hear that due the size of the roof and because it is fibreglass, fitting a solar panel was not advisable. The largest that would fit would have only been a 100w panel and there were risks involved in drilling holes in the roof. Obviously, we were not keen on making holes in our little Daisy and 100w did not seem to be enough to make it worth the cost. Luckily, they advised us to investigate a briefcase solar panel.</p>
<p>We did some research online and found a <a href= https://www.amazon.co.uk/PowerOak-Photovoltaic-Monocrystalline-Generator-Campervan/dp/B09CWS91D6?&linkCode=ll1&tag=cad1307-21&linkId=99ac1e459bb6051e9412150a7a687a1b&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl>200w briefcase solar panel (amazon Link)</a> and we can honestly say very this has been a good buy for us.</p>
 <h3>What is a briefcase solar panel?</h3>
  <p>A briefcase solar panel is a portable and foldable solar panel that can be easily transported and stored, often in the shape of a briefcase or suitcase, hence the name. They typically consist of 3 or 4 connected solar panels which generate solar power.</p> 
 <h3>Practicality</h3>
  <p>Our panel has 4x50w solar panels which fold up neatly into a square briefcase shape measuring 52x52 cm when folded which is simple to store in our van behind a chair when not in use, which for us is practical. It has clips to keep it secure when closed and a little carry handle to make moving it around easy. The panel is relatively lightweight weighing just 6.5kg which light enough for a single person to move around but still heavy enough to withstand a small breeze, although the briefcase design as shown below, does have eyelets to enable you to secure the panel in more windy conditions. The panel comes with MC4 connectors and cable, so it is very simple to set up-you literally plug it in and you are good to go!<p>

 <h3>Portability and flexibility</h3>
  <p>I am sure having a panel on top has many advantages, you can just leave it up there and forget about it! We thought that this was always the best option but, over the last 18 months we have seen people needing to move their whole van to make sure they get enough sun. As we know the Sunlight moves throughout the day causing shadows over the van. They are also fixed so you are generally unable to position them at angles to make the most of the sun for the whole day. </p>
<p>With our Solar panel we can practically position it anywhere with minimal effort and without having to move the van. It can be on our roof, the windscreen or just about anywhere on the ground when we are in a quiet or isolated location. The design of the briefcase includes fold out supports so you can also choose the angle of the panel to maximise the solar input. </p> 
  <p>One of the bigger advantages for us is flexibility. We can choose what battery to charge and connect the panel to either the Powerbank or the leisure battery, dependent on our needs which makes it flexible and practical for life on the road. To do this though you will need a MPPT charge controller, or you will fry your battery! Ours is a <a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/victron-mppt-solar-charge-controller/s?k=victron+mppt+solar+charge+controller&linkCode=ll2&tag=cad1307-21&linkId=80261e4511f5ec7295047f8c9777baa1&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl>Victron smart solar charge controller (amazon Link)</a> which also has a nifty Bluetooth app so I can more accurately check the state of my leisure battery in general but also provides data on how much solar is being generated by the panel, which me know when and how to move and position the panel.</p>

 <h3>Maintenance and durability</h3>
  <p>Solar panels in general do need regular cleaning which can be difficult if you don’t have a ladder on your Van. They get dusty and dirty quite quickly, particularly if you are in one of warmer and drier destinations such as Spain, Portugal for example. This will directly impact the performance of the panel and in our experience regular maintenance is essential. With a briefcase solar panel, it is simple to maintain and clean, you simply lay it out in front of you and give it a good wipe!</p>
  <p>In terms of durability, we can say that even though we purchased this in 18 months ago, it is still in good condition and working as it should. According to the manufacturer the panel front surface of this is made of ETFE material, which is considered to be long lasting, corrosion resistant and should protect the panel to provide longevity. Of course, because the panel is moved around frequently it is more at risk of damage just through probability, so we are always really careful to store it securely. 
We also purchased a <a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/page/768594F3-A89A-42A1-BED9-B1F3A4545BB9?ingress=2&visitId=59457cf8-b443-4f5a-9221-001e6b759be6&linkCode=ll2&tag=cad1307-21&linkId=48d4c492b710173c950d4e84611ef462&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl> Bluetti Powerbank (amazon Link)</a> at the same time This has enable us to keep our laptops and other devices charged up and plugged in so we can keep working on the road.</p>
 <h3>Performance</h3>
  <p>So how well does it work in practice? Although the panel is a 200w panel, the reality with this panel and with most panels is that this is not the amount of solar it will draw at one given moment. On a sunny day in general the panel generates about 160w, which will charge the Bluetti or the leisure battery in about 4 and half hours. It does generate power on an overcast day, and this is often enough to sustain the battery while we are working on the laptop.</p>

 <h3>Potential Improvements and drawbacks</h3>
   <p>As mentioned earlier one of the main drawbacks (and strengths in my opinion) is that you do need to put it outside and bring it back in each time you use it. This does mean that when in use you do need to be in the Van. This is not such an issue for us as we tend to use it on workdays when we are in the Van anyway. The cabling is adequate but could be longer, we have an <a href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Solar-Panel-Extension-Cable/dp/B0BNKTQPGD?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=cad1307-21&linkId=0e9a6681922957f6c295a8ccfe704ddc&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl> Solar Extension Cable Amazon Link</a> for ease, but ultimately it is long enough to reach into the van through windows, plus the Powerbank could just be moved closer.</p>
 <h3Other considerations</h3>
  <p>You do need a Powerbank or a MPPT controller connected with extra Anderson connections to your leisure battery to use this and most other solar products. We purchased our Bluetti powerbank at the same time which we will review separately because quite frankly my fingers now ache from all this typing! We also took advice and had the MPPT and Anderson connection fitted to the battery professionally, but it was not particularly expensive.</p>
  <p>The panel if purchased with the Powerbank can also be used at home, just set up the panel in the garden or balcony and voila! Free electricity for you home to reduce those energy bills and provide yourself with a green and sustainable energy source both on and off the road which during the current cost of living issue can only be a bonus.</p> 
  <p>That’s it folks! I hope you enjoyed the review and found it informative. We recommend the panel and other products discussed in the review. If you want to know more or to purchase these products, I have added the buttons below for you to click and start shopping.</p>
