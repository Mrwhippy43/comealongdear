<h2>One tip to keep warm during winter Vanlife adventures</h2>
<h5>(We not sponsored for this review)</5>
<h3>The “Sole Mio” 100% Wool blanket.</h3>
<p>Are you old enough to remember those itchy blankets our parents put on our beds in the winter? I am…..in the days of yore before mass produced duvets was a household staple. I also remember thinking why oh why have you punished me with this big old itchy blanket you evil beings!</p>
<p>Little did I know then that it was these bad boys that kept us warm in the winter and it is them that keep Dan and I nice and toasty now. </p>
<p>When we first got our Van, it was winter and we was too scared to use the heating system through fear of it killing our batteries and using up all our gas in a few days. This was not totally irrational, after all we had no solar, an old lead acid battery and a 3.6 kg gas bottle as our set up. In the first few weeks we just had our old super thin duvet and our trusty Sol Mio to help us keep warm and do you know what, it worked.</p> 
<p>The blanket is 100% wool and conserves so much heat, even when we woke to find frost forming on the inside of the windows! I took quick peek at the Sole mio website and according to the website they have been manufacturing these since 1948 and the blankets also come with a 10-year warranty. They are durable and made to last so I would say they are a buy once item. Our blanket is 70x100 inch and is big enough to cover our bed which is around a double, if it was for a bed at home, possibly try a bigger one if you want it to hang over the sides. They are easy to store away when not in use (they take up less room than a think duvet) and if you have two, one can go underneath the sheet to toast yourself in a woolie sandwich!</p>
<p>Ours is red but you can often find them in various colours and although quite expensive brand new, you can pick them up on eBay for a reasonable price. If you are really lucky you can find them in charity shops or in your nan’s linen cupboard! You could also just lookout for a 100% wool blanket, it does not have to be Sole Mio but this is the one we have so I can only speak for this product.</p>
<p>Drawbacks are the price for a brand-new blanket, on the website they are over €300 but as I said you can pick them up elsewhere. The itchiness can put people off too, you can use a flat sheet underneath to manage this, personally I like the itchiness because I am just bit odd! They also shed a little bit and we tend to end up with a bit of red fluff in places but it is totally manageable within a normal cleaning regime.</P>
<p>This product is a thumbs up from us, for sure. If you want to avoid the freeze in winter; have a really basic setup, want to reduce the draw on your battery or save on gas then go get yourself one of these and keep your bed nice and snuggly in the winter.</p>
