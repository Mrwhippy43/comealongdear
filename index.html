      <h4>Hello and welcome to our website</h4>

      <p>We're Dan and Steve, lovers of all things adventure! At the end of 2021 we decided to sell everything we owned and hit the road in Daisy, our trusty VW T4 campervan.</p>

      <p>Since then, we've been traveling the UK and beyond in search of beautiful places, interesting people, and new experiences. Vanlife has been a dream come true for us, we love sharing our adventures and making precious memories for us to look back on.</p>

      <p>On this website, you'll find our latest YouTube adventures, stories in our blog page lovingly named "Read all about it", tips and essentials we pick up along the way in our "tried and tested" page, and photos from our travels via our Instagram link.

We hope that our experiences will inspire you to hit the road and explore the world in your own way.</p>

<h4>How we began our Vanlife journey</H3>
<p> In spring 2021 Dan and I were both working full time, Dan was a manager in charity and I was working a registered mental health nurse for my local NHS trust.</p>

   <p> We was lucky, we had managed to scrape together a mortgage on our house, our jobs were reasonably well paid and I even had a fancy electric car! (I had to pay for this and in all honesty I felt embarrassed by the extravagance!). No bragging here, we was and still are very grateful for everything we worked hard to achieve but there was always a sense that we were someway imprisoned by this. We worked full time and hardly had any time to enjoy the life we had made. Each weekend after the necessary chores were completed we found ourselves with the Sunday night blues knowing we had to get back to work on Monday in the never ending cycle of the rat race.</p>

   <p> One evening I (Steve) was sat watching YouTube and came across the RV Living channel and this re-awakened my long time desire to drive off into the sunset in a motorhome. This was something I remember talking about as young as 19. I had always felt the general socially expected manner of living; having children, going to university, getting married and buying a house was not for me. I really struggled to find value and joy in that. Don’t get me wrong, I know these are all amazing opportunities in life and not everyone gets a shot at them.</p>

   <p> Anyway I digress! I was watching the van life vlogs and felt I was watching other people living the life I wanted. Being the impulsive soul I am, I began looking at how we could turn this into a reality. It was not simple. We had to sell the house that we had only owned for about 3 years, so it was mostly a debt. We had other debts as people do, so we had to calculate what we would have left and how we would find work to sustain us. I won’t go into all the boring nitty gritty but it worked out to have a enough to buy a small campervan and a little put aside to support us to get on the road and our journey began</p>
