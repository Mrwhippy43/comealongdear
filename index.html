      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>Hello and welcome to our vanlife journey!</p>

      <p>Hi peeps we're Dan and Steve, lovers of all things adventure! At the end of 2021 we decided to sell everything we owned and hit the road in Daisy, our trusty VW T4 campervan.</p>

      <p>Since then, we've been traveling the UK (and beyond in the near future) in search of beautiful places, interesting people, and new experiences. Vanlife has been a dream come true for us, we love sharing our adventures with all of you, our family and friends and also making precious memories for us to look back on.</p>

      <p>On this website, you'll find our latest YouTube adventure, stories in our blog lovingly named "Read all about it" tab, tips and essentials we pick up along the way in our "tried and tested tab, and photos from our travels via our Instagram link.

We hope that our experiences will inspire you to hit the road and explore the world in your own way.</p>

      <p>Thanks for following along with us!</p>

We are open to opportunites to work with brands and businesses that compliment and enhance the Vanlife experience using travel related equiptment, software, travel companies and related clothing.
