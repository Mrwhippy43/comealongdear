      <p>Hello and welcome to our vanlife journey!</p>

      <p>We're Dan and Steve, lovers of all things adventure! At the end of 2021 we decided to sell everything we owned and hit the road in Daisy, our trusty VW T4 campervan.</p>

      <p>Since then, we've been traveling the UK and beyond in search of beautiful places, interesting people, and new experiences. Vanlife has been a dream come true for us, we love sharing our adventures and making precious memories for us to look back on.</p>

      <p>On this website, you'll find our latest YouTube adventures, stories in our blog page lovingly named "Read all about it", tips and essentials we pick up along the way in our "tried and tested" page, and photos from our travels via our Instagram link.

We hope that our experiences will inspire you to hit the road and explore the world in your own way.</p>

      <p>Thanks for following along with us!</p>

We are open to opportunites to work with ethical brands and businesses that compliment and enhance the Vanlife experience using travel related equiptment, software, travel companies and related clothing.
