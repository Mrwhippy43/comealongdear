<h1>Welcome to our blog spot where you can read all about our journey into van life and beyond. </h1>

<h2>On this page we will be sharing with you our experiences of travelling full time, our favourite places to visit and share our top tips on helping you get the most out of this lifestyle</h2>

<h3>After much deliberation we decided to dedicate this page to our TOP 5 REASONS for embracing van life so grab a coffee, sit back, relax and read all about it! </h3>
<p> Before diving into our top 5 we think it is worth sharing with you what our lives looked like prior to starting our journey. In spring 2021 Dan and I were both working full time, Dan was a manager in charity and I was working a registered mental health nurse for my local NHS trust. We was quite lucky, we had a mortgage for a reasonable sized house, our jobs were reasonably well paid and I even had a fancy electric car (I had to pay for this and in all honesty I felt embarrassed by the extravagance!). We was and still are very grateful for everything we had worked hard to achieve, but there was always a sense that we were someway imprisoned by this.. We worked full time and hardly had any time to enjoy the life we had, each weekend after the necessary chores were completed we found ourselves with the Sunday night blues knowing we had to get back to work on Monday and the never ending cycle of the rat race.</p>

<p> One evening I was sat watching YouTube and came across the RV Living channel and it re awakened the long time desire to drive off into the sunset in a motorhome. This was something I remember talking about as young as 19. I had always felt the general socially expected manner of living; having children, going to university, getting married and buying a house was not for me. I really struggled to find value and joy in that. Don’t get me wrong these are all valuable opportunities in life that not everyone gets.</p>
<p> Anyway I digress, I was watching the van life vlogs and felt I was watching other people life the life I wanted and being the impulsive soul I am, I began looking at how we could make this possible. It was not simple, we had to sell the house that we had only owned for about 3 years, so it was mostly a debt. We had other debts as people do so we had to calculate what we would have left and how we would find work to sustain us. I won’t go into all the boring nitty gritty but it worked out to have a enough to buy a small van and a little put aside to support us in getting on the road. So without further ado here are the Top 5 reasons for starting our van life journey. </p>

<h3> Coming in at the very top…..TIME.</h3>

<p>Time as we all know is the most precious commodity we have. For us we found ourselves lacking in any time to just unwind and relax, sure we would have each evening to ourselves and weekends but it was always jaded by knowing how limited it was. Nothing felt in balance and I personally found myself wishing my life away, yearning for retirement when we would have more of our time to ourselves to just do simple things life grow vegetables, go for walks and see the world. Of course we did get to do these things but there was just no balance and we often felt that working until we was 68 to enjoy a very small amount of time at the end of our lives was just not how our experiences of being alive should be, I was very mindful that I may not even be in a position from a physical perspective to be able to enjoy life and travel when we did get to the so called golden years. Dan worked a lot with people who were retired and he was all too aware from the stories his colleagues would tell him that although we often think we can enjoy all our plans for retirement in later life, it very often does not happen this way and by the time we get to a place where we have the time to enjoy life our bodies and minds are just too tied to enjoy what we worked so hard to achieve</p>

<h3> Next on the list…PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH </h3>

<p>Dan always found time even when working to get out and exercise but even then he felt it was not nearly enough. The daily dredge of travelling by train to work and then all the daily challenges of the job often left him feeling tense and stressed out at the and of each day and he would often be left feeling mentally exhausted. Dan did and still does find busy spaces extremely anxiety provoking. My physical health was not great and my blood pressure was high and my job, despite being a Nurse was very much tied to sitting at a desk which led to weight gain and neck and shoulder pain daily. I also worked all through the pandemic and in all honesty I was burnt out and despite always enjoying helping others I felt each day that my time in the job was coming to an end. Each day I would be having imaginary arguments in my head and just feeling angry all the time. I know now that this would end up with me be seriously ill and that I was at breaking point, it was getting to the point that if I had not moved on I would have ended up being sacked because I could not keep my emotions in check, I was full up and the metaphorical glass was overspilling.
<h3>Coming in at number 3…SEEING THE WORLD (well the UK so far!) </h3>

<p>Travel is something that we rarely go to do. We has never really the type to have holidays each year, mostly because I am tight and refused to spend lots of money for one week of travelling! We did have some holidays away, some cheap ones too. One time we just packed a tent and went off to Cornwall for a few days which was really nice. The trouble really was the lack of time to travel often, although I had a good amount of annual leave from work I was often too tired to contemplate all the planning involved with a few days away. Dan and I had always wanted to see more of the world but as most will know, commitment to full time job made that very difficult. Call us greedy but we wanted more than  just a few days away and unfortunately sometimes when you do have a holiday you feel that you need time to unwind your work brain to enjoy this and we often found ourselves not able to enjoy seeing the sights as much as we would like.  There was also the perspective of routine. I totally respect the value of routine but I do have an impulsive streak and the same routine everyday was killing my soul! Getting up each morning, showering, cleaning my teeth, driving to work, coming home, making dinner…eugh! I found this probably one of the most challenging things about our old life, I needed variety and sadly when you start making commitments to employment and a home you pay for it in with a strict routine to maintain it. Nowadays I actually enjoy some of our  routine when it comes to periods of working, it is really important to have structure in life but it also needs to be balanced so that the structure is not your whole life</p>

<h3>Next on the list at number 4 is…SELF DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>This is about finding our what you are capable of. The routine and structure we had before was challenging because it was boring not because it helped our development. When sit in the same routine, nothing ever changes and therefore you never really get to find out what you can really do. Prior to starting our journey most of self-development was either dominated by what our employers thought our development should be or constricted by the limited time we had to pursue other interests. Now don’t get me wrong we are all different and some people are able to do both in tandem and hats off to them but we are not those people! We had to figure out so many different things to start our journey and find ways of working. We have tried training as English language teachers, gained security licences, learned about maintaining our vehicle (very much work in progress), learned how to live without conveniences such as a shower, hot water and heating. This was so powerful because we relearned how to appreciate the simplest things in life, I have come to believe that the less you have available the sweeter it life tastes. Don’t get me wrong I am all too aware just how much not having enough to meet your needs impacts on people every day, I am talking about having too much and it spoiling your appreciation for some of the simpler things. Dan has learned how to create and edit media to create our YouTube channels and I have been learning how to write computer code in HTML, this website is written in the code I learned and I find it really fascinating (nerd alert!) and I love finding out how to do things myself so I don’t need to pay others to do it for us!</p>

<h3>Last but not least…WE PAY OURSELVES FOR OUR TIME</h3>

<p>Do you ever feel that every time you earned a crust someone came along an pinched half of it? We did. From the mortgage or rent, the council tax, the electricity, the gas, the tv licence..this list goes on. Each time we get our hard earned wages we end up lining someone else’s pockets. We found little opportunity to save money for our future and resented that we was constantly working for others. Of course you can start your own business but this is a risky venture and often saddles many with even more debt than they started with. We wanted to keep what we earned for ourselves and in the usual mode of life this is a near impossibility. We have now created  a trade off this with. Yes we do earn a lot less than we used to but we now keep all of what we earn to support a life we want to life and we are even able to put a small amount aside for a rainy day. We now work when we need to and I can tell you this is far less than we ever did before. We are still able to go out an have lunch every now and then and enjoy small luxuries. This is possible as once you have your van, you simply do not have the outgoings required of conventional living. Yes we do have to keep up the Van and pay for diesel but I had to do that with my car to travel to and from work before this. Our outgoings are limited and this will hopefully eventually mean that when we are ready to settle back down we will be in a position to have a very limited mortgage and be able to work part time, well in theory anyway. I have always been one of those people that don’t like to hand over my cash (my motto is “if it is not 50p, I am not interested!) and we just love that we can stem that flow of our hard earned cash from seeping into the overgrown pockets of the financially privileged.</p>

<h4>So there we have it, we could go on an explore more of these reasons as we have found more a and more reasons each day as to why we have chosen  this lifestyle. We are grateful everyday for this opportunity, and I am very aware that this lifestyle can be out of reach for many. Vans are not cheap and lots of people won’t even have the ability to finance the expensive journey of learning to drive. This life is not the glamour that social media would have us believe either, it can be really challenging and it is not for everyone. That said we could not imagine going back to living how we was before and for us we would not change a thing. Well, thank you for taking the time to read our first blog and we hope you enjoyed it.
